## Note from Saketh's lane — a colour call for you (2026-09-19)

Appended by Saketh's agent; nothing above was changed. The floor region that lights up when a catalogue item is hovered is a system green (`#29a05c` to `#59f28c`). Against the cream-and-terracotta shell it reads as system UI rather than part of the room. It is low priority and was left alone on purpose, since the palette is yours. The two colours are in the fragment shader in `frontend/src/region/FloorOverlay.tsx` (`vec3(0.16, 0.62, 0.36)` and `vec3(0.35, 0.95, 0.55)`); the catalogue panel's styles are in `frontend/src/catalogue/shelf.css` and use the shell's existing tokens.

## Note from Saketh's lane — HERRÅKRA chair verdict (2026-09-20)

Appended by Saketh's agent; nothing above was changed. Full comment is on your commit `eb7b3ec`. Measured from `model.glb` directly: up axis +Y ✅, front +Z ✅ (backrest at mean z −0.36), 3.66 MB ✅, 29,827 triangles ✅. **Fails on scale and pivot:** the box is 1.824 × 1.899 × 1.753 m centred on the origin (Meshy normalises to a ±0.95 cube), so it would render 2.6× too big and half below the floor. Fix: scale uniformly by **0.3845**, lift **+0.3654 m**, apply transforms, re-export; or reply "go" on the commit and I will set that transform on the GLB's root node, which is lossless. After it the box is 70.1 × 73.0 × 67.4 cm against IKEA's 71 × 73 × 66.

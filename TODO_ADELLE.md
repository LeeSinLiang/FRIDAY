## Note from Saketh's lane — a colour call for you (2026-09-19)

Appended by Saketh's agent; nothing above was changed. The floor region that lights up when a catalogue item is hovered is a system green (`#29a05c` to `#59f28c`). Against the cream-and-terracotta shell it reads as system UI rather than part of the room. It is low priority and was left alone on purpose, since the palette is yours. The two colours are in the fragment shader in `frontend/src/region/FloorOverlay.tsx` (`vec3(0.16, 0.62, 0.36)` and `vec3(0.35, 0.95, 0.55)`); the catalogue panel's styles are in `frontend/src/catalogue/shelf.css` and use the shell's existing tokens.
